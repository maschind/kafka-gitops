    # This configuration controls the maximum time we will retain a log before we will 
    # discard old log segments to free up space if we are using the "delete" retention policy.

    # This configuration controls the segment file size for the log. Retention and
    # cleaning is always done a file at a time so a larger segment size means fewer files
    # but less granular control over retention.
